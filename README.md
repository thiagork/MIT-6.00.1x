MIT 6.00.1x - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

These are my implementations of the Problem Sets for the "MIT 6.00.1x - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" course.

This course started on 30th August 2018 and ended on 2nd November 2018.

This repository has the following files:  
  • 6.00.1x-pset2.py - Problem Set 2  
  • 6.00.1x-pset3.py - Problem Set 3 "A hangman game"  
  • 6.00.1x-pset4.py - Problem Set 4 "A wordgame"  
  • 6.00.1x-pset5.py - Problem Set 5 "Caesar Cipher Program"  
  • story.txt - A "Caesar cipher" encrypted story, used on Problem Set 5  
  • word.txt - A file containing a few thousand words used on Problem Sets 4 & 5  
Other Problem Sets were not included because they were just questions with multiple choice answers.
